# Logistic Regression Comparison

This project demonstrates and compares four different logistic regression modeling strategies using a sample dataset. The comparison highlights the effects of **feature scaling** and **class balancing using SMOTE**.

## 🔍 Models Compared

1. **Basic Logistic Regression**  
   - No scaling  
   - No class balancing  

2. **Logistic Regression with Feature Scaling**  
   - StandardScaler applied  
   - No SMOTE  

3. **Logistic Regression with SMOTE**  
   - Class imbalance handled with SMOTE  
   - No feature scaling  

4. **Logistic Regression with SMOTE + Feature Scaling**  
   - Combines both SMOTE and StandardScaler
